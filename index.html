<h1 align="center">Java App That Tells Available Budget and Balances</h1>

<p align="center">This is an app that tells a person's available balance and deposits in a bank account. It can be used for a real world application
or just for fun. I thought that it was pretty cool to make this. It's one of the first apps that I coded in Java. I hope that you all
enjoy my app.</p>
